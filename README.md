# ToDo App

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

I do this challenge to help me improve my coding skills by building some projects.

**To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The Project

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS library

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I'm always looking to improve my skills doing any challenges. 
So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email me lucianomgarriga@gmail.com.

Please share this project with anyone who will love it.

**Have fun!** ðŸš€
